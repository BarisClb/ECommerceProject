# ECommerceProject  
  
   Plans:  
  
   1-) EMail Check for User/Seller Create/Update
   2-) JWT / Authorization / Authentication  
   3-) Pagination  
   4-) Sort By (Name, Price, Date)  
   5-) EMail Notification for Orders (It will be implemented but it will probably stay disabled.)  
  
   Maybe:  
   1-) User Mail  
   2-) Mails between Users  
   3-) Reply System (Comment to Comment)  
   4-) Notifications in User Mail  (Replies to Comments, Comments to Product, Order Status...)
